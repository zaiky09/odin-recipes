<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Biryani is a fragrant and flavorful Indian rice dish made with basmati rice, marinated meat (usually chicken or lamb), and a blend of spices. 
The meat is marinated and then layered with partially cooked rice, herbs, and fried onions. The dish is then slow-cooked to allow the flavors to meld together. 
Biryani is often served with raita, a yogurt-based side dish, and is known for its aromatic spices and rich taste.</p>

<h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the Chicken: In a large bowl, mix together yogurt, lemon juice, ginger-garlic paste, ground turmeric, ground coriander, ground cumin, red chili powder, garam masala, and salt. Add the chicken pieces, ensuring they are well-coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably overnight.</li>
            <li>Cook the Rice: Rinse the basmati rice under cold water until the water runs clear. In a large pot, bring water to a boil with whole spices (bay leaves, cinnamon stick, cloves, and green cardamom). Add the rice and cook until it's 70-80% done. Drain and set aside.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Biryani Base: In a large pan, heat ghee or oil and fry the sliced onions until golden brown. Remove half of the onions and set aside for garnish. To the remaining onions, add chopped tomatoes and cook until soft.</li>
            <li>Add Marinated Chicken: Add the marinated chicken to the pan with the onion-tomato mixture and cook until the chicken is browned and partially cooked.</li>
            <li>Layer the Biryani: In a large pot, layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken mixture. Sprinkle fresh mint and coriander leaves, saffron milk, and fried onions between layers. Repeat until all ingredients are used.</li>
            <li>Cook on Low Heat: Cover the pot tightly with a lid or foil to trap the steam. Cook on low heat for 20-25 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld and the rice to fully cook.</li>
            <li>Serve: Once done, gently fluff the biryani with a fork. Serve hot, garnished with fried onions and fresh coriander, alongside raita.</li>
