<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Chicken shawarma is a flavorful Middle Eastern dish made from marinated chicken that is stacked on a vertical rotisserie. 
    As the chicken slowly cooks and rotates, it is thinly shaved off and typically served in a pita or flatbread. 
    The dish is often garnished with toppings like fresh vegetables, pickles, and sauces such as garlic sauce, tahini, or hummus. 
    The marinade, usually a mix of spices, yogurt, and lemon juice, gives chicken shawarma its distinctive taste.
